## Summary

María Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her relentless fight against dictatorship and for a democratic transition in Venezuela. In a notable gesture, she dedicated part of her award to former President Donald Trump, who has publicly asserted that he deserved the honor himself. This recognition has sparked a mix of reactions, including criticism from the White House, which accused the Nobel Committee of prioritizing political considerations over genuine peace efforts.

Amidst these developments, tensions in the region are escalating due to U.S. military activities near Venezuela.

Additionally, Cuba has warned of imminent threats to regional stability stemming from U.S. operations. A former Biden administration official has raised concerns that troop deployments near Venezuela may be indicative of potential regime change strategies, further complicating the geopolitical landscape in the Caribbean.
