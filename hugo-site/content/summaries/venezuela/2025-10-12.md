## Summary

María Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her relentless advocacy for democratic rights in Venezuela. Her recognition has invigorated the opposition movement and drawn renewed global attention to the ongoing political turmoil in the country, where President Nicolás Maduro's government continues to face accusations of authoritarianism.

In the wake of Machado's win, reactions have been mixed.

This situation reflects the complex dynamics surrounding the Nobel Peace Prize, which has a history of recognizing controversial figures. Analysts suggest that Machado's award could enhance international support for the Venezuelan opposition and intensify pressure on Maduro's government to address the country's democratic deficits.
